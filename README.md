> **Empowering small businesses with crystal-clear financial visibility.**

## Overview

**CashFlowDashboard** is being built for the **[DVHacks 2026](https://dvhacks2026.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=discover)** hackathon.

**Theme:** *Innovating for Business Resilience.*
This event challenges developers to spend 2 weeks crafting solutions that solve real-world problems, with a specific focus on tools that help businesses survive and thrive in volatile markets.

## Problem Statement

Small business owners and freelancers often fly blind when it comes to cash flow.
- **Complexity:** Existing tools are bloated accounting suites that require a degree to navigate.
- **Cost:** Enterprise-grade forecasting is too expensive for early-stage ventures.
- **Uncertainty:** Without clear visibility into future cash positions, businesses struggle to make informed hiring or purchasing decisions, often leading to avoidable liquidity crunches.

## Solution

CashFlowDashboard is a lightweight, focused tool designed to bridge the gap between "back-of-the-napkin" math and expensive ERP systems. It provides:

- **Real-time Tracking:** Instantly record and view cash inflows and outflows.
- **Visual Trends:** Intuitive charts that make financial health understandable at a glance.
- **Smart Forecasting:** Projections for 30, 60, and 90 days to help owners peer into the future.
- **Actionable Alerts:** Specialized notifications for low balance thresholds or unusual spending patterns.

This solution directly addresses the hackathon's goal of *helping businesses* by giving owners the clarity they need to stay solvent and grow.

## Key Features

This project is currently in its **MVP (minimum viable product)** phase, developed specifically for the hackathon:

- ** Executive Dashboard:** A clean, responsive overview tracking current balance and recent activity.
- ** Transaction Management:** Easy-to-use interface to Add, Edit, and List income and expenses.
- ** Forecast Visualization:** A dedicated view showing projected cash availability.
- ** Alerts System:** A notification center for critical financial warnings.
- ** Modern UI:** Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a professional, responsive mobile-first experience.
- **Backend:** Powered by **ASP.NET Core MVC** for robust server-side logic.
