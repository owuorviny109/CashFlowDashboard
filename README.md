## Overview

CashFlowDashboard is a predictive financial intelligence platform for small businesses. It uses **Linear Regression Analysis** to forecast cash positions 30-90 days ahead, providing early warnings for cash flow shortfalls.

**Key Features:**
*   Real-time cash flow dashboard with interactive charts
*   Multi-scenario forecasting (Base, Optimistic, Pessimistic)
*   Smart alert system for low balances and anomalies
*   Transaction management with search and filtering

## Technology Stack

*   **ASP.NET Core MVC 8** – Server-side rendering
*   **.NET 8 (LTS)** – Long-term support
*   **Entity Framework Core** – ORM with migrations
*   **SQLite** – Zero-config database (PostgreSQL-ready)
*   **Chart.js** – Financial visualizations
*   **Tailwind CSS** – Modern UI framework
*   **Serilog** – Structured logging

## Architecture

**Layered Architecture:**
```
Controllers (Presentation) → Services (Business Logic) → Repositories (Data Access) → Database
```

**Design Patterns:**
*   Repository Pattern for data abstraction
*   Service Layer for business logic encapsulation
*   DTO Pattern for data contracts
*   ViewModel Pattern for type-safe views

**Core Algorithms:**
*   **Linear Regression**: `ForecastService.cs` calculates slope/intercept for projections
*   **Alert Rules**: `AlertService.cs` monitors thresholds and anomalies
*   **Confidence Intervals**: ±2σ (95% confidence) bounds for forecast uncertainty

For detailed architecture documentation, see [Backend Architecture Spec](Docs/backend-architecture.md).

## Future Roadmap
*   **Reports & Exports:** Generate PDF/CSV reports for income/expenses and projections.
*   **Bank Feeds:** Plaid integration for automated syncing.
*   **Tax Vault:** Auto-calculate estimated quarterly tax payments.
*   **Multi-Tenancy:** SaaS support for Accountants managing multiple clients.
